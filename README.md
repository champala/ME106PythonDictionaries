Project: Python Dictionaries and CSV files
Author: @champala
Description: This program reads a volunteer.csv file and gives the user two options to write to a new csv file. Option 1 allows user to print all volunteers to a new csv file. Option 2 allows them to print only people's information that begin with the letter of their choosing. 
Important: The volunteer.csv file should be placed on the same directory as this script. If ran more than once, it will overwrite the previous files.
