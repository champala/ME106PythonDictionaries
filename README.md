<b>Project:</b> Python Dictionaries and CSV files<br/>
<b>Author:</b> @champala<br/>
<b>Description:</b> This program reads a volunteer.csv file and gives the user two options to write to a new csv file. Option 1 allows user to print all volunteers to a new csv file. Option 2 allows them to print only people's information that begin with the letter of their choosing. <br/>
<b>Important:</b> The volunteer.csv file should be placed on the same directory as this script. If ran more than once, it will overwrite the previous files.
